    "This section enriches a DataFrame df_tweets, containing tweet data, with new insights extracted through custom functions. The extract_mentions function identifies and compiles user mentions from each tweet into a new 'mentions' column, using regular expressions to capture any text following the '@' symbol. Simultaneously, the analyze_sentiment function applies the TextBlob library to evaluate and append each tweet's sentiment to the DataFrame, resulting in two new columns: 'polarity', indicating the emotional tone ranging from negative to positive, and 'subjectivity', quantifying the presence of personal opinion versus factual information. These enhancements facilitate a deeper analysis of the social interactions and emotional undertones present in the tweet corpus."

    "In our Twitter sentiment analysis, we leveraged both a bar chart for emotion distribution and a conceptual pie chart to dissect sentiment polarity and subjectivity, providing a holistic view of user engagement. The bar chart vividly illustrated the prevalence of various emotions, notably showing a significant lean towards Neutral sentiments, which suggests a substantial portion of tweets convey information or comments without strong emotional undertones. Conversely, the pie chart aimed to offer a broader perspective on sentiment polarity, distinguishing between Positive, Neutral, and (hypothetically) Highly Subjective tweets based on polarity and subjectivity scores. This contrast underscored the dominance of Neutral sentiments, implying a predominant trend of tweets that refrain from conveying marked positivity or negativity, possibly reflecting a preference for objective discourse on the platform. Together, these visualizations paint a comprehensive picture of the emotional and sentiment landscape within the analyzed Twitter dataset, offering valuable insights into public mood and engagement trends."
